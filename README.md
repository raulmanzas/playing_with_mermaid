# playing_with_mermaid
Exploring mermaid diagrams using [this VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-mermaid).

Tips:
- In order to make the plotted diagrams visible both on VSCode and github one must use backticks syntax;
- Sometimes, disconnected nodes may not be rendered on github, so make sure you make connections as much as you can.
